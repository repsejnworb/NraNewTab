Chrome insists on putting "chrome://newtab" as title if there's no title,
instead of putting something useful like a localized "New Tab" there.

As a workaround, use a space as title. An empty tab is better than one saying
something cryptic. Chrome puts "chrome://newtab" if the title is whitespace too,
but it doesn't recognize all the whitespace characters listed at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation) :-)
